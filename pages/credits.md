This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) togother with a little help from my friends:
- Tom Johnson's [Jekyll Documentation Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html), a great feature rich documentation theme
- Alexander Joseph's [jekyll-swagger](https://github.com/jexhson/jekyll-swagger) to create API explorer pages from the Swagger specs.
- Aidan Feldman's [Jekyll-get](https://github.com/18F/jekyll-get) to get Swagger JSON files from a remote site
- Mike Bland's [hash-joiner](https://github.com/18F/hash-joiner), required by jekyll-get
